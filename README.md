# SimLispy

City-builder game written in Bobbi-lisp

The data model is based on [SimCity BuildIt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SimCity:_BuildIt). I found it to be genuinely addictive due to its very carefully tuned slot-machine mechanics. This project [began](https://github.com/porkostomus/simter) as a way to aid in production strategies. I was a new programmer who saw a problem that could be solved with programming, and created an ad-hoc GUI app to solve my problem (managing production of items in the game) without realizing I could have just used a spreadsheet. 

I recently found that while looking through my old GitHub repos, possibly to clean things up in order to focus? I wouldn't know, because it turned out to be a trap and now I'm not only playing the game again, but writing still new programs to better understand it. Now I'm more interested in studying the game's data model, and possibly shed some light on what characteristics are involved in creating something so endlessly engaging.

I actually was under an illusion that I was the only one still playing the game since it came out in 2013. But then I found there is a discord and reddit community for it and my entire worldview had to shift to accomodate such a novel discovery.

It's very important to talk about FarmVille, from which the game inherits its exploitative mechanics. When I looked into it, I found an article that talked about how Facebook used it to discover where the line is where so many notifications will cause a certain number of users to become annoyed but still effectively increase use, and here we have what we have today... the invasive ad-driven unusable trash heap of an internet. 

I actually hate the game in so many ways and feel like an addict for continuing to play it. In truth it is a form of escape, because in real life I have relatively few resources and little influence it feels great to be put in a position where I have the safety, freedom and power to build communities and see them flourish. For this reason it is especially depressing that even my power fantasy involves engaging with an entity that is literally trying to prey upon me by misleading me and exploiting my weaknesses.

Oh what's that? You want links?

The way I think that I can turn this power around for "good" would be to use it as a data science project. Can you hear Satan laughing?
